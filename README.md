# Spotify-Playlist-Downloader
Because spotify "shut down" cracked versions I found(with GPT's help) an alternative...

In order to be able to listen to your playlists without spotify you have to follow a small procedure...
you have to download your spotidy playlist from a spotify downloader tool.
I used "Spotify-downloader.com" because it also downloads the meta data of the songs wwhich means you have the album name, album cover, singer name, etc...
link is https://spotify-downloader.com/

The Problem is---> Spotify downloader puts its name-watermark before the title of the song
For example: 
I downloaded Sweet Child O Mine form Guns N Roses But the downloaded tilte would be "Spotify-Downloader - Sweet Child O Mine"
In order to fix this a asked GPT for a programm that changes the name of the song to the original name.
It works as this:
You define the PREFIX global variable according to what oyu want to remove from the beggining of the file(I say this because the prefix varies according to the spotify downloader tool you use...)
You put your file in the project file so you have less trouble giving the path to the programm.
You run the programm.
you move the "renamed" directory wherever you want...
CHAT GPT COOKED!!!
